// HTTP Server -- How to Use //

This java program will run an HTTP web server, up for contact at localhost, port 6789.

=> java Server.HTTPServer
---------------------------------------------------

This web server is multi threaded, so it can respond to many requests at the same time, instead of having
to deal with one request at the time.

It also makes of a Logger class, which keeps logs of server activity. You can find it printed on a
log.txt file, created in the directory where you're running the program from.

You can test it out by running the server and testing http://localhost:6789/mp1
